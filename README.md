# One of my first react projects...

### Other ideas

##Idea

Noughts and Crosses.

##MVP:
Functioning game where no winner is declared.

##Stretching to complete:
Tracking of scores througout games.
Could make it so you could programmatically make different size boards? 4x4 5x5?

## What I learnt

I learnt during this mini react application about the value of keeping state in the right place! May as well make life easy for yourself and keep it as low as you can. That way prop drilling is avoided.
